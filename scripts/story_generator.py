REQUIREMENTS:
- Write in first person ("I" perspective)
- Frame as a "true story" the narrator experienced
- Set in a realistic, relatable location: workplace
- Include specific, authentic details that make it believable
- Build tension gradually through normal situations becoming wrong
- Use past tense narration
- End with lasting impact on narrator ("I still..." or "To this day...")
- Establish workplace/setting routine before introducing horror element
- Include multiple "lasting impact" reflections throughout the ending

SETTING PROMPT:
I worked as a {setting['job']} at {setting['place']}. Describe 2-3 typical work routines and normal details about the job before the incident. What started as an ordinary {setting['time_period']} turned into something I'll never forget. The story should involve {setting['element']} and focus on human antagonists or realistic threats with subtle wrongness.

WORKPLACE DETAIL REQUIREMENTS:
- Specific job procedures, equipment, or daily tasks
- Names of coworkers, supervisors, or regular customers (if applicable)
- Physical layout details of the workplace
- Normal schedule, break routines, or typical interactions

ENDING IMPACT REQUIREMENTS:
- Include 2-3 different "I still..." or "To this day..." statements
- Mention specific triggers that bring back memories
- Describe how the experience changed narrator's behavior or perspective
- End with an unsettling final thought or ongoing fear

TONE: Believable, personal account with authentic details. Should feel like it could really happen.

EXAMPLE OPENING STYLE: "I never really thought much about [relevant workplace detail] until that {setting['time_period'].split()[0]} in [month]. I'd been working as a {setting['job']} for [time period] when..."
