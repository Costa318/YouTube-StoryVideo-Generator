But once the experiment starts, something else slips through the cracks. As our narrator drifts between waking and dreaming, a shadowed presence lingers at the edges of his vision, waiting. The deeper he ventures, the more fragile the line between dream and reality becomes\u2026 until the question is no longer whether he\u2019s in control, but whether he\u2019ll ever wake up at all.\n\nTonight\u2019s fabulous story is 'Project W.I.L.D' by Tin 77, kindly shared with me via the Creepypasta Wiki and read to you here under the conditions of the CC-BY-SA license:\n\nhttps://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/Project_WILD\n\nhttps://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/User:Tin77\n\nReal human voice horror narrat",
