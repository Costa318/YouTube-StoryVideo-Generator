was sort of like a bluff or something. I
 

02:24:01.680 --> 02:24:04.230 align:start position:0%
was sort of like a bluff or something. I

02:24:04.240 --> 02:24:06.630 align:start position:0%

02:24:09.910 --> 02:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
was kind of right because I didn't. I
 

02:24:09.920 --> 02:24:12.870 align:start position:0%
was kind of right because I didn't. I
kept<02:24:10.160><c> going</c><02:24:10.319><c> towards</c><02:24:10.720><c> San</c><02:24:10.960><c> Francisco</c><02:24:12.160><c> and</c><02:24:12.560><c> was</c>

I<02:24:17.760><c> made</c><02:24:17.920><c> it</c><02:24:18.080><c> in</c><02:24:18.240><c> one</c><02:24:18.479><c> piece</c><02:24:18.720><c> and</c><02:24:18.960><c> on</c><02:24:19.200><c> time.</c>

I made it in one piece and on time.
 

02:24:20.479 --> 02:24:22.389 align:start position:0%
I made it in one piece and on time.
But<02:24:20.640><c> it</c><02:24:20.880><c> was</c><02:24:21.120><c> majorly</c><02:24:21.520><c> on</c><02:24:21.760><c> my</c><02:24:21.920><c> mind</c><02:24:22.080><c> for</c><02:24:22.240><c> the</c>
