00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
almost a crawl, the light didn't change
 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.910 align:start position:0%
almost a crawl, the light didn't change

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 align:start position:0%

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.830 align:start position:0%

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
steady rhythm, still holding that same

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
it was that somehow matched my speed
 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.229 align:start position:0%
it was that somehow matched my speed

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.110 align:start position:0%

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 align:start position:0%

to get spooked. I finally came to a full

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 align:start position:0%

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:12.159 align:start position:0%

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 align:start position:0%

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.630 align:start position:0%
back up and turn around, but I realized
