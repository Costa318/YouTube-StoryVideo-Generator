Again, I wasn't overly confrontational
about<00:52:05.760><c> it,</c><00:52:06.000><c> but</c><00:52:06.240><c> he</c><00:52:06.480><c> was</c><00:52:06.720><c> standing</c><00:52:07.040><c> by</c><00:52:07.280><c> my</c><00:52:07.520><c> car</c>

00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
and quite obviously staring at me. So, I
 

00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:12.390 align:start position:0%
and quite obviously staring at me. So, I
figured<00:52:11.040><c> I</c><00:52:11.280><c> better</c><00:52:11.520><c> work</c><00:52:11.680><c> out</c><00:52:11.839><c> what</c><00:52:12.000><c> his</c><00:52:12.240><c> deal</c>

00:52:19.109 --> 00:52:19.119 align:start position:0%

00:52:19.119 --> 00:52:21.990 align:start position:0%
him, "Can I help you?" And then, without

00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
was safely in the employee parking lot,
 

00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:28.390 align:start position:0%
was safely in the employee parking lot,
it<00:53:26.079><c> was</c><00:53:26.240><c> still</c><00:53:26.480><c> me</c><00:53:27.280><c> that</c><00:53:27.520><c> was</c><00:53:27.680><c> about</c><00:53:27.920><c> to</c><00:53:28.079><c> have</c>

00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
it was still me that was about to have
 

00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:31.109 align:start position:0%
it was still me that was about to have
that<00:53:28.720><c> really</c><00:53:29.119><c> bad</c><00:53:29.440><c> day.</c>

00:53:31.109 --> 00:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
that really bad day.
 

00:53:31.119 --> 00:53:33.910 align:start position:0%
that really bad day.
And<00:53:31.359><c> so</c><00:53:32.000><c> the</c><00:53:32.240><c> working</c><00:53:32.559><c> day</c><00:53:32.800><c> ends.</c><00:53:33.359><c> I</c><00:53:33.680><c> drive</c>

00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
And so the working day ends. I drive
 

00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:36.069 align:start position:0%
And so the working day ends. I drive
back<00:53:34.160><c> home.</c><00:53:34.559><c> And</c><00:53:34.960><c> as</c><00:53:35.200><c> I'm</c><00:53:35.359><c> pulling</c><00:53:35.599><c> into</c><00:53:35.920><c> the</c>

back home. And as I'm pulling into the

00:53:42.549 --> 00:53:42.559 align:start position:0%

00:53:42.559 --> 00:53:45.750 align:start position:0%
parking spaces. So I figured that we got
off<00:53:42.800><c> lucky.</c><00:53:44.160><c> But</c><00:53:44.319><c> then</c><00:53:44.880><c> after</c><00:53:45.200><c> I</c><00:53:45.440><c> walked</c>

00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:45.760 align:start position:0%

00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:47.910 align:start position:0%
off lucky. But then after I walked
