00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:32.560 align:start position:0%

His smile got wider and he started

And<00:11:02.399><c> he</c><00:11:02.560><c> was</c><00:11:02.720><c> weaving</c><00:11:03.200><c> through</c><00:11:03.519><c> traffic,</c>

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
And he was weaving through traffic,

And he was weaving through traffic,

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.470 align:start position:0%

thinking that he'd slowed down, but he
didn't.<00:11:11.600><c> And</c><00:11:11.760><c> then</c><00:11:11.920><c> I</c><00:11:12.079><c> heard</c><00:11:12.320><c> it.</c><00:11:13.279><c> Sirens</c>

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
didn't. And then I heard it. Sirens
 

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.550 align:start position:0%
didn't. And then I heard it. Sirens

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:22.880 align:start position:0%

00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
remember the tires screeching.
 

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:41.830 align:start position:0%
remember the tires screeching.
I<00:28:40.399><c> looked</c><00:28:40.640><c> back</c><00:28:40.799><c> and</c><00:28:40.960><c> saw</c><00:28:41.200><c> them</c><00:28:41.440><c> standing</c>

over and over like it was my fault. Tom
 

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.990 align:start position:0%

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
didn't say much, just kept his eyes on
 

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.710 align:start position:0%
didn't say much, just kept his eyes on

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
up in that. I kept thinking about how
 

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.830 align:start position:0%
up in that. I kept thinking about how

I'd wanted this to be different, how I'd

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to leave all of that stuff
 

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.350 align:start position:0%
wanted to leave all of that stuff

to Tom and apologized again. I told him

we could try again, that this was just a

I'd like that, too. I went inside, still
