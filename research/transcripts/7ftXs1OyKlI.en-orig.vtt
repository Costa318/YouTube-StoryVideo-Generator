Jack<00:04:19.040><c> yelled</c><00:04:19.359><c> that</c><00:04:19.519><c> we</c><00:04:19.680><c> were</c><00:04:19.759><c> armed,</c><00:04:20.320><c> which</c><00:04:20.479><c> I</c>

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
Jack yelled that we were armed, which I
 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.430 align:start position:0%
Jack yelled that we were armed, which I
still<00:04:20.880><c> think</c><00:04:21.040><c> was</c><00:04:21.280><c> a</c><00:04:21.440><c> bad</c><00:04:21.600><c> idea.</c><00:04:22.720><c> We</c><00:04:22.960><c> obviously</c>

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
still think was a bad idea. We obviously
 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.350 align:start position:0%
still think was a bad idea. We obviously
didn't<00:04:23.680><c> have</c><00:04:23.840><c> any</c><00:04:24.000><c> weapons</c><00:04:24.400><c> with</c><00:04:24.560><c> us,</c><00:04:24.960><c> but</c><00:04:25.120><c> I</c>

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
didn't have any weapons with us, but I
 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.790 align:start position:0%
didn't have any weapons with us, but I
figured<00:04:25.600><c> Jack</c><00:04:25.919><c> thought</c><00:04:26.080><c> the</c><00:04:26.240><c> bluff</c><00:04:26.639><c> might</c>

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
figured Jack thought the bluff might
 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.430 align:start position:0%
figured Jack thought the bluff might
scare<00:04:27.040><c> the</c><00:04:27.199><c> guy</c><00:04:27.440><c> off.</c><00:04:28.400><c> Instead,</c><00:04:29.040><c> the</c><00:04:29.280><c> man</c>

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
scare the guy off. Instead, the man
 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.790 align:start position:0%
scare the guy off. Instead, the man
looked<00:04:29.680><c> up</c><00:04:29.840><c> at</c><00:04:30.000><c> us</c><00:04:30.080><c> and</c><00:04:30.240><c> yelled</c><00:04:30.560><c> back</c>

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
looked up at us and yelled back
 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.110 align:start position:0%
looked up at us and yelled back
something<00:04:30.960><c> that</c><00:04:31.199><c> made</c><00:04:31.360><c> me</c><00:04:31.600><c> freeze</c><00:04:31.919><c> up.</c><00:04:32.800><c> He</c>

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
something that made me freeze up. He
 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.590 align:start position:0%
something that made me freeze up. He
said,<00:04:33.440><c> "Me,</c><00:04:33.919><c> too,</c><00:04:34.160><c> kiddo."</c><00:04:34.960><c> Then</c><00:04:35.199><c> he</c><00:04:35.360><c> held</c>

said, "Me, too, kiddo." Then he held
 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.110 align:start position:0%
said, "Me, too, kiddo." Then he held

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
something up in the air and waved it
 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.430 align:start position:0%
something up in the air and waved it
