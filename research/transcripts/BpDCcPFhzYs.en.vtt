like seeing my clothes sticking out, but

that morning. A few days later, I
 

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.230 align:start position:0%

noticed my desk chair turned slightly
 

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.550 align:start position:0%
noticed my desk chair turned slightly

maybe<00:14:53.760><c> I</c><00:14:53.920><c> was</c><00:14:54.079><c> just</c><00:14:54.240><c> not</c><00:14:54.399><c> paying</c><00:14:54.639><c> attention.</c>

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
maybe I was just not paying attention.
 

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.750 align:start position:0%
