# YouTube Horror Story Video Generator

An AI-powered pipeline for creating long-form horror story compilations optimized for YouTube monetization.

## Overview

This project generates 3-hour horror story compilations using AI-driven creative writing, professional narration, and adaptive length management. Designed for the ultra-long format strategy that maximizes YouTube watch hours and ad revenue.

## Key Features

- 🎨 **AI-Driven Story Creation**: Creative story concepts generated by Claude 4.1 Opus
- 🎙️ **Professional Narration**: Integration with Kokoro-FastAPI for high-quality TTS
- 📊 **Adaptive Length Management**: Automatically optimizes compilations for exactly 180 minutes
- 🎯 **Revenue Optimization**: Based on analysis of successful horror YouTube channels
- 🔄 **Automated Pipeline**: End-to-end automation from concept to final video

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Claude Code CLI** with Opus access
2. **Kokoro-FastAPI** running on localhost:8880
3. **FFmpeg** for audio processing

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/YouTube-StoryVideo-Generator.git
cd YouTube-StoryVideo-Generator
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Generate creative horror compilation
python3 scripts/creative_story_generator.py

# Optimize length with audio generation
python3 scripts/adaptive_length_manager.py
```

## Pipeline Phases

### Phase 1: Creative Story Generation
- AI generates cohesive compilation themes
- Creates unique story concepts with plot hooks
- Evaluates and ranks concepts for quality selection

### Phase 2: Adaptive Length Management  
- Generates audio for all stories using Kokoro-FastAPI
- Measures actual narration lengths
- Intelligently selects optimal story combination for 180-minute target

### Phase 3: Asset Generation (In Development)
- Atmospheric horror image generation with Stable Diffusion
- Background audio processing and mixing
- Video timeline creation and synchronization

### Phase 4: Final Assembly (Planned)
- Automated video compilation with transitions
- YouTube-optimized metadata generation
- Upload automation and scheduling

## Research Findings

Based on comprehensive analysis of successful horror YouTube channels:

- **Ultra-long format** (180+ minutes) requires dramatically fewer views for monetization
- **Volume strategy** generates more annual watch hours than viral approach  
- **Consistent posting** builds algorithm favor and sustainable revenue
- **Professional storytelling** over literary complexity optimizes engagement

## Configuration

Set up your environment:

```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN="your-token-here"
```

Ensure Kokoro-FastAPI is running:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8880:8880 --name kokoro-full ghcr.io/remsky/kokoro-fastapi-cpu:latest
```
